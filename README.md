# saberschema

The goal of this project is to produce JSON schemas that are verified
and accurate to the requirements of Beat Saber, various mods, and tools
that consume or produce Beat Saber's JSON files.

Ideally, this results in a consolidated knowledge base for the formats
and their expected values.
